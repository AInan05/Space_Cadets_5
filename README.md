This is my attemp at SCChallengeSpiro.

This program can simulate a spirograph.
Multiple spirographs can be simulated and the coordinates are calculated depending on the varius properties of the spiros.

Type R r O values to add a spiro and type !exit to start simulating.

Some values for trying:
100 175 100
90 30 15
150 90 120
100 40 20
150 25 40
150 90 45
144 96 48
