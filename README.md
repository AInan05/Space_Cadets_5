This is my attemp at SCChallengeSpiro.

This program can simulate a spirograph.
Multiple spirographs can be simulated and the coordinates are calculated depending on the varius properties of the spiros.

Type R r O values to add a spiro and type !exit to start simulating.

Some values for trying:
100 175 100 -
90 30 15 -
150 90 120 -
100 40 20 -
150 25 40 - 
150 90 45 - 
144 96 48
