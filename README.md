This is my attemp at SCChallengeSpiro.

This program can simulate a spirograph.
Multiple spirographs can be simulated and the coordinates are calculated depending on the varius properties of the spiros.

Type R r O values to add a spiro and R G B values as ints <= 255, then type !exit to start simulating.

Some values for trying:
100 175 100 + RGB;
90 30 15 + RGB;
150 90 120 + RGB;
100 40 20 + RGB;
150 25 40 + RGB;
150 90 45 + RGB;
144 96 48 + RGB;
